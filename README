WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::Ajax, version 0.02 (alpha)

Plugin for WWW::Mechanize that provides the XMLHttpRequest object.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

• Relative URIs are now supported.
• URIs are now checked to see whether they originate from the same
  server as the current page.
• Fake cookies (created by setRequestHeader) are no longer clobbered
  when there are real cookies.
• The event methods addEventListener, removeEventListener and
  dispatchEvent have been added.
• There are now constants for the readyState
  (XMLHttpRequest.UNSENT etc.).
• Non-standard HTTP method names are no longer folded to uppercase.
• The ‘open’ method now dies if the method name is not a valid HTTP
  token or  if  it  is  CONNECT,  TRACE  or  TRACK  (case-tolerant).
• The fragment part (#...) of a URI is now stripped.
• The ‘open’ method now dies if the URL’s scheme is not supported.
• Username and password are now gleaned from the URL if present and if
  the corresponding args to open are omitted.
• The username and password info no longer leaks from one object  to
  the next. (The send method used to set the credentials for all XHR
  objects that didn’t have any.)
