Revision history for WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::Ajax

        • Relative URIs are now supported.
        • URIs are now checked to see whether they originate from the
          same server  (and port and  scheme)  as  the  current  page.
        • Fake cookies (created by setRequestHeader) are no longer
          clobbered when there are real cookies.
        • The event methods addEventListener, removeEventListener and
          dispatchEvent have been added.
        • There are now constants for the readyState
          (XMLHttpRequest.UNSENT etc.).
        • Non-standard HTTP method names are no longer folded to
          uppercase.
        • The ‘open’ method now dies if the method name is not a
          valid HTTP token or if it is CONNECT,  TRACE or  TRACK
          (case-tolerant).
        • The fragment part (#...) of a URI is now stripped.
        • The ‘open’ method now dies if the URL’s scheme is not
          supported.
        • Username and password are now gleaned from the URL if pres-
          ent and if the corresponding  args  to  open  are  omitted.
        • The username and password info no  longer  leaks  from  one
          object to the next. (The send method used to set the creden-
          tials for all XHR objects that didn’t have any.)
